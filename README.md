# Placeasy
Placeasy is a College Placement Management web application to automate the placement activities
and generate report of students during placement in excel or pdf format.
This is my 6th Semester mini project which I have made for my College.

Motive Behind Making This...
My college was taking students academic and personal details through google form.
And for each company they have to make separate excel sheet for eligible students manually by typing.
After each round of placement again they have to make separate excel sheet manually for a particular company.
Then again they have to make separate excel sheet for finally placed student,number of offers company have given and many other reports manually by typing.
But with the help of this web application all the above task can be done on a single click....

You will find many project for placement management system but this is different and little complex as I have used some COMPLEX DATABASE QUERIES,given notification option to notify students and generating report in excel and pdf format in 14 different options.

Technology used...
1. html
2. css
3. Bootstrap
4. Javascript / JQuery
5. mySQL
6. PHP
7. XAMP Server

Note...
1. Import the sql file (placement.sql) into XAMP / WAMP server. This project contains 12 tables.
2. Make sure to have a internet connection because this web application use online library like JQuery,Bootstrap,etc.
